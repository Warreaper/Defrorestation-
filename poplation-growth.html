    <p>THE IMPACT OF US</p>
    <ol> <p>Before deforestation:</p>
<br>
   <li> Forests serve as crucial ecosystems, providing habitat for diverse plant and animal species.</li>
    <li>They act as carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and regulating the climate.</li>
    <li>Forests maintain water cycles, prevent soil erosion, and provide resources like timber, food, and medicine.</li>
 <ol>
      <br>
      <p> After deforestation:</p>
      <br>
<ol>
    <li>Cleared land replaces lush forests, often for agriculture, urban development, or logging.</li>
   <li> Loss of habitat leads to a decline in biodiversity. Soil erosion increases, disrupting water patterns and causing sedimentation in rivers and streams.</li>
    <li>Release of stored carbon exacerbates climate change, impacting global weather patterns and ecosystems.</li>
  <ol>
    <p>Overall, deforestation results in ecological imbalance, loss of ecosystem services, and negative consequences for both local communities and the global environment.</p>
