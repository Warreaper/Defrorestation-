    <h1>WHAT TO DO  ?</h1>
    <p> Deforestation happens because people find it more profitable to cut down trees for farming or selling wood.( just two examples provided)
      Economic incentives are a big factor to strop considering the government prefers to create income instead of protecting the forest 
      ^ A way to counter this -> showing how the forests are more valuable than initially thought, considering they soak up an abundance of harmful carbon dioxide if left unaltered. 
    </p>
    <h1>Possible solutions</h1>
    <li>Tax those who harm the environment to discourage
deforestation.
      Pay landowners to keep forests instead of chopping them down.</li>
    <li>Give money to communities to stop them from cutting down trees, but be careful because it might lead to more farming.</li>
     <li> Make laws to stop cutting trees in important areas, but be aware that deforestation might move elsewhere.
    <li>Make agreements with companies not to buy products from deforested areas, which can help reduce cutting trees.</li>
      <li>Make it harder for farmers to get loans unless they follow environmental rules, which has reduced deforestation in some places.</li>
